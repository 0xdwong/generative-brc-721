  "description": "> ***TLDR**: This proposal introduces the Generative BRC-721 standard, a solution to optimize block space usage in the Bitcoin ordinals ecosystem, accommodating more creators and fostering innovation. The standard utilizes a \"deploy\" operation to create a Generative BRC-721 collection with unique traits stored on-chain. A \"mint\" operation then generates Non-Fungible Ordinals, referencing the traits from the deploy operation. This process cuts down block space usage between 50% and 90%. The impact of the proposed standard was demonstrated through a case study with a Generative BRC-721 collection called \"OrdiBots,\" showing a block space reduction of 55%. Front-ends will need to adapt to recreate and display images from the mint inscription text data. This proposed standard lays the groundwork for efficient, decentralized innovation in the Bitcoin blockchain.*",
